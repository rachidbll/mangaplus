Sprint 1 Progress:

- **Asset Replacement:** Replaced local asset paths with placeholders from a CDN to ensure the application is visually complete without relying on local files.
- **Initial Content:** Populated the application with random text and icons on first load to provide a functional baseline and fixed the existing bug where the app crashes if no data is returned from the API.
- **Admin/User View Separation:** Refactored the main application component to cleanly separate the user-facing manga reader from the admin dashboard.
- **Site Update Notification:** Implemented a notification system to inform the administrator that they need to update the site information.

Sprint 2 Progress:

- **Dedicated Admin Section:** Enhanced the admin dashboard structure and moved website settings from localStorage to the database.
- **Essential Settings UI:** Implemented API endpoints for fetching and updating website settings, and refactored the Settings UI to use these endpoints.
- **Dynamic Content Integration:** Connected the settings UI to the frontend, ensuring real-time updates to user-facing pages.
- **Bug Fixes:** Addressed the NGINX 502 error by ensuring Prisma client generation during deployment and resolved the `mangaInfo` ReferenceError in the Navigation component.
